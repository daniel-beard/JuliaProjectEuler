The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
=#

function num_divisors(n)
  count,i = 2,2 # accounts for 'n' and '1'
  while (i^2 <= n)
    if n%i==0
      count += 2
    end
    i += 1
  end
  count
end

function triangle_number(n)
  return convert(Int64,(1/2)*n*(n+1))
end

function calc()
  i = 2
  while num_divisors(triangle_number(i)) < 500
    i += 1
  end
  triangle_number(i)
end
@time println(calc())
